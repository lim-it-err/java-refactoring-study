# Distributed Job Scheduler - Refactoring Exercise (Hard)

## Overview
This exercise involves refactoring a **distributed job scheduling system**. The current implementation lacks scalability, proper data handling, and concurrency management. Your task is to refactor the system to enhance **performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability**.

## Issues to Address
1. **Raw Type Usage**:
    - The `List` and `Map` should use generics for type safety.
2. **Inefficient Job Management**:
    - Jobs are stored as concatenated strings instead of structured objects.
    - Searching for jobs is done using inefficient string operations.
3. **Concurrency Issues**:
    - No synchronization or thread-safety mechanisms exist.
    - Workers can be modified while jobs are being assigned, causing race conditions.
4. **Inefficient Cleanup and Job Distribution**:
    - `removeWorker` removes jobs using an expensive `.contains()` string lookup.
    - The job distribution mechanism is simplistic and does not consider worker load.
5. **Design Pattern Improvements**:
    - Implement a **Factory Pattern** for job creation.
    - Introduce a **Strategy Pattern** for job distribution.
    - Use an **Observer Pattern** to notify workers asynchronously.
6. **Separation of Concerns**:
    - Create separate classes for `Job`, `Worker`, and `JobQueue`.
    - Implement a **Repository Pattern** to manage persistence.
7. **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**:
    - Introduce a queue-based job management system.
    - Support worker failover mechanisms.
    - Implement retry logic for job failures.

## Tasks
1. **Write JUnit test cases** to verify job scheduling and worker management.
2. **Refactor the code** to:
    - Implement **thread safety** using synchronization or concurrent collections.
    - Improve **job data structures** for fast lookups and modifications.
    - Use appropriate design patterns for better **maintainability and flexibility**.
3. **Enhance Scalability & Performance**:
    - Implement **load balancing** among workers.
    - Optimize **job assignment strategies**.
    - Introduce **asynchronous processing** where applicable.

## Bonus Challenge
- Implement **distributed scheduling** with multiple instances handling jobs.
- Introduce **event-driven processing** using messaging queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

Good luck! ðŸš€
